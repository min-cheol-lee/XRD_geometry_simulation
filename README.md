# XRD_geometry_simulation
Simulation for X-ray diffraction (XRD) geometric conditions of 4-circle diffractometer system with a fixed grazing angle condition, and pump beam geometry for pump-probe experiments. You can find the following results from this simulation.

- visualization of diffraction + pump-probe geometry
- omega, two-theta, chi, phi angles 4C alignment for X-ray beam
- incidence grazing angle, polarization angle for optical beam
